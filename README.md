## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm [Schubi](https://www.github.com/schubi93)

I'm currently researching Embedded Device Security at the University of Applied Sciences Augsburg, being a member of the **Institute of innovative Safety and Security [HSA_innos](https://github.com/hsainnos)**.

---
As my current project, I'm developing hardware in `Verilog`, adding peripheral components to the PicoRV32 Soft-core, running `C/C++` code.
Connecting the resulting system to a Linux via Kernel Modules in `C` and applications in `Python` to overcome the need of external secure elements.
