## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm [Schubi](https://www.github.com/schubi93)

I'm currently researching Embedded Device Security at the Technical University of Applied Sciences Augsburg.
Member of the **Institute of innovative Safety and Security**, called [HSA_innos](https://github.com/hsainnos)

:raising_hand: Contact me, even about PCB design or car stuff, I will gladly assist you :muscle:

As my current project, I'm working on device identities, their lifecycle requirements and implementation for resource-restricted IoT devices in cooperation with industrial partners.

Prior, I developed hardware in `Verilog`, adding peripheral components to the PicoRV32 Soft-core, running `C/C++` code.
Connecting the resulting system to a Linux via Kernel Modules in `C` and applications in `Python` to overcome the need of external secure elements.
